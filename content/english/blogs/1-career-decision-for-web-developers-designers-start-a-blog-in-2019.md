title: "The #1 Career Decision For Web Developers & Designers: Start a Blog in 2019!"

<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he biggest joy of my short freelancing career is actually not building websites, finding new clients, or even teaching. It&#8217;s blogging! Listen to me: Start a Blog in 2019! Do it.</div><hr class="lead-hr">



<p>Blogging is not only fun and rewarding, but it&#8217;s double the fun if you are a web developer or designer.</p>



<p>I love to add content to it, to style it, create new functionalites and experiments. It&#8217;s my own baby to tweak and customize.</p>



<p>I can share value with others, teach new concepts that I&#8217;ve learned, and recommend tools that I use. It makes me a little money, brings new business leads, and helps with networking.</p>



<ul><li>Do you want to teach the new things you are learning?</li><li>Do you want a coding playground to build on?</li><li>Are you looking for new leads or job prospects?</li><li>Do you want to make a little side income?</li><li>Do you want to become a leading voice in your field?</li></ul>



<p>Then start a blog in 2019!</p>



<p>I can say it has been the single biggest means of advancement for me and my business as well as joy to interact with daily.</p>



<p>So here it is, December 27. You have a few days.&nbsp;Set that blog up and launch&nbsp;it&nbsp;January 1. Make next year the year that you put yourself out there and get yourself heard!</p>



<p>In fact, here are <a href="/4-reasons-why-every-web-developer-should-start-a-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="In fact, here are 4 compelling reasons ever web developer should have a blog already. (opens in a new tab)">4 compelling reasons ever web developer should have a blog</a> already.</p>



<h2>How to start a blog in 2019</h2>



<h4>1. Get Hosting &amp; a FREE domain</h4>



<p>Go sign up at Bluehost for the Basic plan. </p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="With this link, you can get hosting for only $3.95 a month AND a FREE domain! (opens in a new tab)" href="/recommends/bluehost" target="_blank">With this link</a>, you can get hosting for only $3.95 a month <strong>AND a FREE domain! </strong>Also a free SSL certificate and 24/7 support.</p>



<p>While your hosting is your rented space on the web, your domain is the address of your site.</p>



<p>So this will be your site url (i.e. google.com, jimbocreative.com, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people use their names ( jonathandoe.com ), their business name ( skyrocketdesign.com ), or something unique but related to your business or brand.</p>



<p>Be sure to choose your Domain name wisely. Pick one that is simple and one that matches your brand/purpose.</p>



<h4>2. Install WordPress</h4>



<p>Next, install WordPress with Bluehost&#8217;s 1-click WordPress install.</p>



<p>Why WordPress? It&#8217;s the best for blogging, period. It&#8217;s an open-source, well-maintained, solid, content management solution. Nothing compares to it for this purpose.</p>



<p>Once you install WordPress you will need a theme (unless you&#8217;re looking for a custom build). To get up and running with speed, I recommend a theme at first and you can build a custom one later. (If you haven&#8217;t signed up at Bluehost yet, don&#8217;t go theme shopping yet. One step at a time, captain).</p>



<p>I would recommend:</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Genesis Themes - My favorite hands down. Studiopress makes the finest themes both aesthetically and functionally.
My Theme Shop themes - This may be a better choice as these themes give you lots of options to customize your site. My first few themes were from My Theme Shop and they are solid with great customer support.
Astra - Lightweight and fast. And FREE!...well until you upgrade to Astra Pro, which gives you tons of options.

<h4>3. Write, Share, Be Consistent</h4>



<p>Start writing. Write about your code, your new projects, new concepts learned. Just write!</p>



<p>Then Share! Share on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. Share everything.</p>



<p>And this is the most important -> Be consistent. Start with one article a week. Do not bump that up until you are consistent with that&#8230;consistently. If you are consistent, you will be more successful than most bloggers out there.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>What are you waiting for. 2019 is coming!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start a blog in 2019!</p>



<p>Create your kingdom online. Set no limits.</p>
