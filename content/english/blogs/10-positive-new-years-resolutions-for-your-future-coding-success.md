<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve, developers, and it&#8217;s time to start thinking about the year ahead of us. In this article, I&#8217;ll share 10 positive New Year&#8217;s Resolutions for coders and developers to hit the new year running.</div><hr class="lead-hr">



<p>First, let me say thanks to all my readers this year. It&#8217;s been a really good one and you all are an awesome community to be a part of. I&#8217;m looking forward to what next year has in store.</p>



<p>New Year&#8217;s Resolutions are a very serious matter to some. To others, it&#8217;s basically just another day. Wherever you are in that debate, I believe it&#8217;s always good to at least reflect a little and set some goals for yourself. Especially when you are in such a fast-paced field as web-development and tech in-general can be.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve waited until the last minute to set some goals, or haven&#8217;t put much thought into it yet, then let me help you out with a <g class="gr_ gr_66 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="66" data-gr-id="66">fe</g>w.</p>



<h2>Here are 10 Positive New Year&#8217;s Resolutions for your future coding success:</h2>



<h3>1. Become a contributor to your field</h3>



<p>As you continue to advance in your programming knowledge, you should be sharing everything! People like me are always Googling how to do stuff, how to build <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">X,</g> or some sort of definitive answer to a technical question.</p>



<p>Your expertise is not only helpful, but needed in this fast-paced field of web/software development.</p>



<p>You have a unique voice. Let it be heard.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t AT LEAST started a blog, that&#8217;s your first priority. As I&#8217;ve said before, nothing has advanced my freelance and coding career faster than my blog.</p>

<p>Other options that you should explore are:</p>



<ul><li>Starting a YouTube channel. Show us your code, your tips, and your life hacks through video!</li><li>Regularly contribute to social media. Twitter is a great hub for web development networking. Check the hashtags #100DaysOfCode #coding and #codenewbie.</li></ul>

<h3>2. Stop trying to learn everything</h3>



<p>Coding ADD is real. There are so many courses, frameworks, discoveries, fads, and gadgets out there it&#8217;s so hard to learn just one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know exactly what I mean.</p>



<p>You set out to learn Vue.js, but 5 days into it you get sucked into an article about how React is a better option to learn than Vue and will give you more opportunities in the job markets. So you switch and purchase a React course. Then r<g class="gr_ gr_70 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="70" data-gr-id="70">epeat</g> with another gadget in 5 days.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s are two tips that have liberated me completely:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>It takes time to learn a lot and become &#8220;seasoned.&#8221; Stop trying to speed up the process. Enjoy and find confidence in where you&#8217;re at..now.</li><li>You don&#8217;t need to know everything to have a solid coding career. I mean, one can make a lucrative living on CSS alone. Look back at how far you&#8217;ve come and, again, find confidence in what you know already.</li></ol>

<h3>3. Build Something Unique</h3>



<p>You know A LOT, but you don&#8217;t give yourself credit for it. You probably can already build the next YNAB or Evernote, but you won&#8217;t because you are always following the tutorials of others. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a positive New Year&#8217;s resolution for you: </p>



<p>This year come up with an App concept. Sketch it out. Pseudocode it (yes I just used that as a verb). And build it, uniquely, with what you know, and from scratch. No tutorials, &#8220;follow-<g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">alongs</g>&#8220;, or copying half of someone else&#8217;s app.</p>



<p>Wrestle with the concepts, build a little at a time, and Voila!..you will be amazed at how much you already know and how much you are capable of when you really challenge yourself.</p>



<p>I mean, you get a whole year to do it. So do it!</p>

<h3>4. Prioritize your health</h3>



<p>This one is huge. Our job calls us, unless we actively push back, to sit at our desks, hunched over, 8 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People tell us to get up and stretch for 5 minutes every 30 minutes. But what employer is going to give us 80 minutes a day to do that? Also, how many timers do we have to set to stay on &#8220;stretch schedule?&#8221;</p>



<p>Regardless, your health is your success in life. You should place it above your career, your coding, your clients, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make a plan to run in the mornings or after work. Or, start a bodyweight workout plan and do that instead.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t run? How about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="You don't run? How about taking an app like this and going from Couch to 5K in just 9 weeks? (opens in a new tab)" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/couch-to-5k-run-training/id448474423?mt=8" target="_blank"><g class="gr_ gr_42 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="42" data-gr-id="42">downloading</g> an app like this</a> and going from Couch to 5K in just 9 weeks?</p>



<p>How about 7 minutes a day, can you do that? Sure you can. Anyone can. Download this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="How about 7 minutes a day, can you do that? Sure you can. Anyone can. Download this 7 minute workout app and get on it. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7-minute-workout/id650762525?mt=8" target="_blank"><g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">7 minute</g> workout app</a> and get on it.</p>



<p>Make your health a priority. Cut back on the red meat, drink some smoothies, do some workouts. Your body will love you, your mind will become sharp, and you&#8217;ll surely find more success day to day.</p>

<h3>5. Do some freelancing on the side</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ll repeat it, you have the skills. You just need to connect those skills with someone who needs them.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all freelacing is &#8230; meeting the needs of someone else.</p>



<p>There are tons of businesses, bloggers, etc. who don&#8217;t know how to make that button green, how to create a landing page, or how to rank better on Google.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where you come in.</p>



<p>This year let everyone know what you do. Hand out your business card to everyone. </p>



<p>Make some moola on the side. </p>



<p>But beware, you may just become enamored with it and end up quitting your day job. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This year let everyone know what you do.

<p>I cut my teeth on Upwork. Do you know people are charging $80+/hr on there and making quite a living on Upwork alone! More and more well-known companies and hiring on there. </p>

<h3>6. Start reading more</h3>



<p>Personal and professional development through books is a trait found in all successful people. Leaders are readers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From encouraging biographies, classic novels, and business and personal develpment books, making a regular reading habit will propel you forward in life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has been a major factor in my own business from learning <strong>how</strong> to run a business, to technical skills, to inspiration from the lives of others, to hobbies, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start reading more this year. Create a list of the books you&#8217;d like to read and schedule out time to read them. Shoot for 1 book a month to start. </p>



<p>Not a reader? Try <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Not a reader? Try Audible and listen to them when you drive, when you workout, when you go on a walk, etc. You'd be surprised how many books you can get through this way.  (opens in a new tab)" href="/recommends/audible" target="_blank">Audible</a> and listen to them when you drive, when you workout, when you go on a walk, etc. You&#8217;d be surprised how many books you can get through this way. </p>



<p>One subscription I added this year was <a href="https://amzn.to/2AiXe1F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="One subscription I added this year was Kindle Unlimited.

I can&#8217;t express how many hundreds of fabulous books I now have access to at only $10/month! </p>

<h3>7. Step out of stagnation</h3>



<p>Take some time to reflect if you have become stagnant in life.</p>



<p>I worked 10 years in a corporate job I only meant to stay at for a number of months. I got comfortable in it (though miserable) and time flew by. Before I knew it I was in my 30&#8217;s. </p>



<p>This year zero in on those habits, jobs, etc. that you have become stagnant in, comfortable with, and make a plan to exit or propel out of it.</p>



<p>Learn a new skill ( <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Learn a new skill (like learning to code!), take a new challenge, stare life down and take charge.  (opens in a new tab)" href="/introducing-the-learn-to-code-and-get-a-job-in-six-months-coaching-program-2019" target="_blank">like learning to code!</a>), take a new challenge, stare life down and take charge. Leave no regrets!</p>

<h3>8. Work on your confidence</h3>



<p>One way to build confidence is to <strong>look back</strong> at how far you&#8217;ve come, AND<strong>stop looking</strong> at those far ahead of you.</p>



<p><em>Another is to stop thinking everyone is looking at you when you enter a room. They aren&#8217;t.  You know what I mean. </em></p>



<p>Realize that it takes time to become a seasoned coder <em>and at the same time </em>realize how far you&#8217;ve progressed in so little time.</p>



<p>Stand up straight. Speak louder. All those things you truly want for yourself. Read the book below.</p>

<h3>9. Meet up with online aquaintances</h3>



<p>Some of us have some close online followers and friends. We present ourselves certain ways to them and vice-versa. But oh how neat it would it be to switch things up and meet in person.</p>



<p><g class="gr_ gr_57 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="57" data-gr-id="57">Wow</g> I didn&#8217;t know you were so short! Ha, your voice is super deep. You&#8217;re so much more reserved in person! </p>



<p>If you frequently talk with certain people online and feel comfortable doing so, plan a meetup during the year or a plan to attend a conference together ( like a WordCamp ). </p>



<h3>10. Start a new hobby</h3>



<p>You cannot code forever. We talk on Twitter about how we&#8217;ve been up late &#8230; again &#8230; coding or that you&#8217;ve completed your sixth #100DaysOfCode in a row, but is that really good for us? </p>



<p>Is there more to life than coding?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s always helpful to cease doing something that you&#8217;ve been doing for hours on end, and engage in something completely different for a while. That&#8217;s common sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, find a hobby. Pick up biking, hiking, volleyball spiking (yeah I just wanted to rhyme), crafting, photography, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This year, find a hobby.

<p>Don&#8217;t let coding be your whole life. There&#8217;s much, much more out there to enjoy.</p>



<p><strong><em>So what positive New Year&#8217;s Resolutions have you set for next year?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>If you had them for this year, how&#8217;d it go?</em></strong></p>
