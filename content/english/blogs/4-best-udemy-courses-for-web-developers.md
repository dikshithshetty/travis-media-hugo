title: "The 4 Best Udemy Courses For Web Developers And Designers"

---

<p>Among all the talk of bootcamps, college degrees, nanodegrees, etc., there is a much, much more affordable alternative out there&#8230;.<a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a>.</p>
<p>Now you don&#8217;t get the mentorship and the motivation that you get with the former mediums, but if you are disciplined and have the drive and some sort of accountability, you can become a successful programmer via courses on Udemy.</p>
<p>The best part is that there is a sale pretty much every day, around $10 a course. If not, Google a coupon code.</p>
<p>Thus, I have taken a number of courses on Udemy. Some were great, some were not.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to list the 4 best UdemyÂ courses for web developers, in my opinion, the courses that have exceeded my expectations and advanced my knowledge and practice in computer programming.</p>
<p>Not only am I going to give a list of the best Udemy courses for web developers and designers, but I am going to rank them by category:</p>
<h3>#1 &#8211; WordPress Development / PHP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img src="/images/2019/12/best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-zac-gordon-wordpress.png" alt="best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-zac-gordon-wordpress" width="500" height="269" /></p>
<p>Who do you want to teach you the ins and outs of WordPress? Zac Gordon of course!</p>
<p>His course was phenomenal and instrumental in my gaining a confident understanding of the inner workings of WordPress such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Template Hierarchy</li>
<li>Template tags</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Themes</li>
<li>Hooks &amp; Filters</li>
<li>Learning to use the Codex</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>and soon to be added: Plugin development and internal WordPress APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I walked away from this course feeling very confident that I could successfully build and manipulate any WordPress theme and any WordPress site out there in a way that meets best coding standards and practices.</p>
<p>If you feel that you struggle in finding WordPress solutions for your clients, struggle with what is really going on under the hood, or just want to know WordPress more deeply, spend the $10 and take this course.</p>

<h3>#2 &#8211; JavaScript</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img src="/images/2019/12/best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-modern-javascript-from-the-beginning.png" alt="best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-modern-javascript-from-the-beginning" width="500" height="268" /></p>
<p>Now there are loads of resources out there to learn JavaScript.</p>
<p>However, JavaScript has really advanced over the past few years and most of the courses are in a sense outdated or limited.</p>
<p>There was ES5, there was ES6, and there is another on the way.</p>
<p>When I learned JavaScript, you could learn the basics of the language anywhere. But things were changing so fast that I was left outdated as to any new developments.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a course that I am taking now that begins with modern JavaScript in mind and its a course by Brad Traversy called <a href="/recommends/udemy-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone can take this course as it begins with the basics, but the &#8220;modernized&#8221; basics. Don&#8217;t get left behind. Learn rightly, and keep up with the changes.</p>
<p>This course includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basics of JS</li>
<li>The DOM</li>
<li>Object Oriented JS</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>Regular Expressions</li>
<li>ES2015+</li>
<li>and 10 Projects!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s been phenomenal so far and I look forward to completing it.</p>
<p>This course is perfect for you if you are a beginner, an intermediate JS user who hasn&#8217;t kept up with the changes, or any web developer that wants to know JS deeper, and with Gutenberg coming, you need to know it deeply.</p>

<h3>#3 &#8211; Comprehensive Web Development</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img src="/images/2019/12/best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-complete-web-developer-course-2.png" alt="best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-complete-web-developer-course-2" width="500" height="284"  /></p>
<p>Who could have a list of the best Udemy courses for web developers without mentioning the gold standard of Udemy Courses, <a href="/recommends/udemy-webdev-percival" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 by Rob Percival</a>.</p>
<p>Now this isn&#8217;t a course you sit down a take and you&#8217;re done. It&#8217;s too comprehensive.</p>
<p>It is instead a course that you reference from time to time and you refresh your skills with the needed topics that he provides.</p>
<p>The course includes, well&#8230;.everything.</p>
<p>HTML, CSS, CSS3, JS, jQuery, WordPress, Python, APIs, Bootstrap, MySQL, Mobile apps, tons exercises, and on and on.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&#8217;s comprehensive. It&#8217;s also taught by Rob Percival who is well known not only for his passion for web development but his desire to teach and provide value personally for those who take the course. And he is still <a href="https://twitter.com/techedrob" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessible</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend this course for any CodeNewbie because it starts from the very beginning, and I would also recommend it to anyone who codes to have as part of their reference library as it can very advanced as well.</p>

<h3>#4 &#8211; A WordPress Business</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img src="/images/2019/12/best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-complete-wordpress-website-business-course.png" alt="best-udemy-courses-for-web-developers-complete-wordpress-website-business-course" width="500" height="286" /></p>
<p>WordPress powers almost 30% of the web.</p>
<p>Learn it and you can <a href="/why-im-choosing-wordpress-exclusively-freelance">make a business out of it</a>. That&#8217;s a fact.</p>
<p>However, all clients are different, have different requests (demands often), and unique business goals and desires.</p>
<p>There is one course on Udemy that will teach you, comprehensively, a wide range of tools to prepare you for anything your client may ask of you.</p>
<p>There is one course that will take you anywhere from hosting to staging sites to WooCommerce to membership sites, and that is <a href="/recommends/udemy-wordpress-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Complete WordPress Website Business Course, taught by Gregg Davis</a>.</p>
<p>When you begin building websites you need to know how to set up a local environment, what hosting to recommend your clients, what themes and plugins to recommend, management tools, maintenance plans, and all of those things that come alongside of actually building sites for clients.</p>
<p>I recommend this course to anyone looking to <a href="/ebooks">start freelancing</a>, building a web agency, and generally to anyone who wants to equip themselves to provide tons of value and expertise to their clients.</p>
<h3>On Deck</h3>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for me? Here is a list of courses recommended to me that I plan to take in the near future:</p>
<p><a href="/recommends/udemy-vuejs2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue JS 2 &#8211; The Complete Guide</a><br />
<a href="/recommends/udemy-wishlist-member" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Membership Site With Wishlist Member and WordPress</a><br />
<a href="/recommends/udemy-python-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python</a></p>
