title: "4 WordPress Changes That Have Transformed My Blog For The Better"

---

<p>With technology changing rapidly, we have to make periodic adjustments to our websites to stay relevantly operational. This may include visual changes, functional changes, or even investing a little money to provide more solid solutions for our readers. Here are 4 changes I have made recently in WordPress that have transformed my blog for the better. </p>
<p class="textcenter">										<img data-rjs="2" src="/images/2019/12/transformed-my-blog-pinterest-image.jpg" alt="transformed my blog pinterest image" />											</p>
<h2>1. Retina Images</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always placed the thought of incorporating retina images on my blog on the back burner. I&#8217;ll get to it at some point, it&#8217;s not important now.</p>
<p>Until I set it up and saw the dramatic improvement visually.</p>
<p>Need an example? Go to my blog page and everything from the post, &#8220;RelayThat Review: Branded Marketing Images Made Easy&#8221; on March 19, 2018, up through the present are retina images. Look at the Gutenberg post right before it. If you are on a retina device you will see a drastic difference.</p>
<p>In fact, anything prior to the Gutenberg post looks a bit fuzzier on my display. </p>
<p>Setting up retina image functionality is quite easy in WordPress. </p>
<p>To do so, I tried two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retina.js &#8211; <a href="http://imulus.github.io/retinajs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retina.js</a> is simple and recommended in a post by <a href="https://briangardner.com/optimize-images-retina-display/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Gardner</a>. I liked it, but it caused some console errors for all the posts/pages/etc. without retina images. Not cool. </li>
<li>Second, and finally, I installed the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Retina 2x</a> plugin by Meow Apps. All you have to do is upload an image exactly double the size of the intended image on the page. For example, on my blog page I have an image defined of 768 x 450. Thus, when I upload a new image for the blog page, I upload it 1536 x 900. WP Retina 2x will create the half size (768 x 450) image and automatically detect which one to serve in the browser. Here&#8217;s some <a href="https://meowapps.com/wp-retina-2x/tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more info</a> on how to use it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Elementor</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve followed <a href="/recommends/elementor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elementor</a> for a while now and have always found it superior to other page builders (including Beaver Builder by a long shot). </p>
<p>Many people use these page builders to help them build web pages without any knowledge of CSS or HTML. It&#8217;s a wonderful tool for this purpose. </p>
<p>On the contrast, I use it to simply dress up my pages and posts nicely with ease, so I can get back to other coding tasks. It&#8217;s always a temptation to spend time writing custom code on our own sites and making them have all kinds of features, but with other work to do it&#8217;s often better to find a tool to speed up that process. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve followed my posts you will often see orange separator lines, header shape dividers, etc. that just add a little flavor to the page.</p>
<h2>3. Gravity Forms</h2>
<p><a href="/recommends/gravityforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gravity Forms</a> has been a rock-solid solution to creating trustworthy and powerful forms on my site from opt-in forms to my multi-page <a href="/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wplink-edit="true">website worksheet</a>. Forms may seem a basic feature on any website, but it&#8217;s actually a very important one and one that you want to make sure is trustworthy.</p>
<p>In addition, it integrates smoothly with MailChimp, PayPal, has some nice &#8220;ready classes,&#8221; and has tons of hooks, filters, options, and third-party plugins by which to further develop its functionality.</p>
<p>I have complete confidence that when a user fills out a form, survey, etc. that it will do what it&#8217;s set up to do&#8230;.confidence that I do not have with Ninja Forms, MailChimp for WooCommerce, etc. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/reasons-to-use-gravity-forms-plug-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nice post</a> on many of the benefits of Gravity Forms. I highly recommend the $60/yr investment.</p>
<h2>4. Pinterest Integration</h2>
<p>I became convinced of the power of Pinterest about two months ago. I always thought it was mainly for recipes and fluff, so I never gave it much thought. But Pinterest is actually a search engine within itself and can serve to drive tons of traffic any site which uses it effectively. Here are some of my stats since I started &#8220;pinning&#8221; that demonstrate how Pinterest is completely dominating:</p>
<p class="textcenter">										<img src="/images/2019/12/transformed-my-blog-pinterest-referrals.png" alt="transformed my blog pinterest referrals" />											</p>
<p>Now what do you pin in Pinterest if you are a web developer? How do you create enough material to pin often?</p>
<p>Well, you repurpose your blog posts. You give them a different image, with a different caption, and a different appeal. More importantly, you pin consistently and to different relevant boards. But who has time to do that?</p>
<p>No one. You automate it!</p>
<p>I signed up for a trial of <a href="/recommends/tailwind" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tailwind</a>, a powerful application that not only automates pins and Instagram posts, but an application that also provides optimal times to post and analytics. It&#8217;s a rather amazing program. You create a pin, and set it to post to different boards at the optimal times it suggests for weeks in advance.  Give it a whirl.</p>
<p><a href="/recommends/socialwarfare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Warfare Pro</a> also allows me to place a &#8220;pin&#8221; option on my images and even choose the default Pinterest image for each post! Nice.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are more I could discuss that have transformed my blog for the better, but these four are the most recent major changes and changes I will recommend to others.</p>
