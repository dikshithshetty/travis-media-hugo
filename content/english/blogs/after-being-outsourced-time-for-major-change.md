title:  "After Being Outsourced, It Is Time For A Major Change"

---


<p>Everyone knew it was coming; it was just a matter of time. Yesterday, our department at work was officially notified that as of May 1, 2017, we would no longer have a job. We are being outsourced.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they opted to keep me on to be a facilitator between our company and the company the work is being outsourced to. “Fortunately.” Well, I am thankful for this but at the same time I feel that it will only be for a season, and as soon as that task is up I will be on the way out the door as well.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, this is what big companies do. There are budgets and quotas to meet, and if they are able to better do this without a department or a person, then by all means no need to waste time or money.</p>
<p>As for me, I am 35 and have worked and broad range of jobs and have moved up the ladder a number of times. I have worked under bosses who can only type with one finger and around employees who complain continually about how they hate their jobs. I have slaved away in kitchens for minimum wage and I have also attended regular meetings with executives who make four times what I make.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been learning to code in order to transition into a coding career with “some” company. I have developed a huge love for coding. But is this really the path I want to go? Do I really want to continue building other peoples’ empires?</p>
<p>No I don’t.</p>
<p>And frankly, I am changing things.</p>
<p>I am going to begin a freelance career and I will give myself to the end of this year to be doing it full time.</p>
<p>I have a plan and timeline laid out. I have goals and certain drastic adjustments I will make.</p>
<p>This will become a major focus in my blog and I will be sharing my steps and experiences along the way.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks and months I will lay out my timeline, philosophy, which languages and niche I will focus on, my plan to find clients, and much more.</p>
<p>Stay tuned..</p>
