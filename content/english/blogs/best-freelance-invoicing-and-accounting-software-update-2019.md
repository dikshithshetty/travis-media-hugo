<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">F</span>inding a full-featured freelance invoicing and accounting app at a great price can be a challenge. In this post I want to share two apps that I think meet the <em>complete</em> needs of most freelancers.</div><hr class="lead-hr">



<p>I&#8217;ve been through a lot of invoicing and accounting apps. In fact, I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="I've been through a lot of invoicing and accounting apps. In fact, I wrote on article all about it last October.&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)" href="/the-best-invoicing-and-accounting-software-for-freelance-web-designers" target="_blank">wrote an article all about</a> it last October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a lot has changed since then, and I think I&#8217;ve finally ironed out a solid matchup of freelance invoicing apps to not only meet my invoicing and accounting needs, but many others as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t mention apps like Freshbooks and Harvest again as my opinions still stand from the <a href="/the-best-invoicing-and-accounting-software-for-freelance-web-designers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="I won't mention apps like Freshbooks and Harvest again as my opinions still stand from the previous article, but I will speak on the rest.&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)">previous article</a>, but I will speak on the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here we go:</p>



<h3>Pancake App</h3>



<p>This WAS my <strong>go-to app</strong>. This WAS my all-in-one-solution indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then they released an update that broke the Stripe integration (and created a handful of other errors). All of a sudden clients were like &#8220;your payment system isn&#8217;t working.&#8221; So based on Pancake&#8217;s &#8220;well known support&#8221; I reached out and got an answer that the developers were looking into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A week passed with no solution. I had to give clients a workaround. Frankly, it&#8217;s a bit embarrasing to have to do this, but it&#8217;s temporary right? Wrong. Weeks passed, same answer until finally, no further response. Two months in, the invoicing system is still broken and I&#8217;m out. Customer service is really a make or break aspect of your business. </p>



<p>So long &#8230; Pancake app.</p>



<h3>Back to Zoho</h3>



<p>One thing about Zoho, they are a reliable a solid solution. So I went back there. In fact, I gave Zoho One a trial and really liked all the features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But &#8230;&#8230;. it just feels so old and out of date. if you&#8217;ve used it you know what I mean right? Other apps are pleasing to the eye and &#8220;fun&#8221; and Zoho, while reliable, just seems like a step back in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I decided to stay with them until I found an alternative.</p>



<figure class="textcenter"><img src="/images/2019/12/plutio-screenshot.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6413" srcset="/images/wordpress/2018/12/plutio-screenshot-768x450@2x.jpg 1536w, /images/wordpress/2018/12/plutio-screenshot-655x384.jpg 655w, /images/wordpress/2018/12/plutio-screenshot-768x450.jpg 768w, /images/wordpress/2018/12/plutio-screenshot-655x384@2x.jpg 1310w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></figure>



<h3>Parked at Plutio</h3>



<p>And Black Friday brought the answer&#8230;..<a href="/recommends/plutio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="And Black Friday brought the answer.....Plutio! It was listed on AppSumo for a steal price. Since then I have been very, very pleased with it. (opens in a new tab)">Plutio</a>! It was listed on AppSumo for a steal price. Since then I have been very, very pleased with it.</p>



<p>What is Plutio?&#8230;.</p>



<ul><li>It&#8217;s a project management tool</li><li>It&#8217;s a task app</li><li>It&#8217;s an invoicing system</li><li>It has drag-and-drop Proposals and Contracts</li><li>It has a client portal</li><li>It allows teamates</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>I have not looked back since using it and highly recommend it!</p>



<p>But there are two temporary downsides:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The API is in Beta, meaning there is no direct integrations yet (but will soon have them).&nbsp;</li><li>It is not an accounting app, nor should it be with all it has included.</li></ul>



<h3>Not an accounting app?</h3>



<p>Yes. Plutio has sooo much going for it, for it to incorporate all that is involved with being an accounting app would ruin it, IMO. However, I would like to see just a simple income/expenses dashboard, but that&#8217;s getting us sidetracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But no worries. Once it receives it&#8217;s &#8220;integration wings&#8221; I will be linking it up with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="But no worries. Once it receives it's &quot;integration wings&quot; I will be linking it up with Wave Financial (yes that's the name now!). (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.waveapps.com/" target="_blank">Wave Financial</a> (yes that&#8217;s the name now!). Wave is FREE and boasts being FREE forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a rock-solid solution for your all your accounting needs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The perfect match (and price)?</h3>



<p>So with Plutio you get literally EVERYTHING, minus the accounting features. For those, you simply use Wave app. With <strong>just two apps</strong> you have:</p>



<ul><li>Invoicing</li><li>Time Tracking</li><li>Project Management</li><li>Proposals</li><li>Contracts</li><li>Inbox (coming soon)</li><li>Calendar integration</li><li>A CRM</li><li>Full accounting features</li></ul>



<p>Now if you want to keep it completely FREE, Wave will give you invoicing and time-tracking as well. But Plutio gives you ALL the other expensive features in one place.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>So Plutio is currently my go to solution for ALL THINGS minus accounting and I don&#8217;t see that changing anytime soon.</p>



<p>It is currently $15/month but I have a feeling it&#8217;s soon to go up with not only all that it offers but all the coming features on it&#8217;s roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go and <a href="/recommends/plutio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go and try it out for FREE for 14 days! (opens in a new tab)">try it out for FREE for 14 days</a>!</p>



<p>It also has a lively (and refreshing) Facebook group where the creator Leo is very active in it. You would be crazy not to snatch up this app.</p>



<p>That covers all things freelance invoicing. To cover all things accounting&#8230;.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="And to cover all things accounting....Wave Financial all the way. It's a FREE powerhouse.&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.waveapps.com/" target="_blank">Wave Financial</a> all the way. It&#8217;s a FREE powerhouse.&nbsp;</p>
