<p>The month of April was a busy one, and thus I only made it through three books, but they were challenging and enlightening in every respect. Listing these books out monthly helps keep me motivated, encouraged, accountable, and as much as I love seeing reading lists from others, I hope to stir up my readers to keep learning as well with these brief reviews! So here&#8217;s my list of books read in April 2018.</p>
<h2>Books Read In April 2018</h2>
<p>		<a href="https://amzn.to/2HSNAVt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><b>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</b></a></p>

<p>I listened to this audiobook (<a href="/recommends/audible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have you gotten your two free books yet?</a>), and it was absolutely phenomenal&#8230;every single page. A real jerk, yet a genius! I had been a PC guy until about 5 years ago, so it was really interesting to read the relevant and groundbreaking history of Apple that I missed all those years.</p>
<p>There is a lot to learn from this book from good design to the dire importance of networking, to making good products, to marketing, to how many important roles can only be held by specific types of people. </p>
<p>No one else could have grown Apple to where it is today except for Jobs. I really didn&#8217;t want the book to end. Just read it for yourself and prepare to be challenged.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2wa8QVp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rise of the Youpreneur by Chris Ducker</a></strong></p>

<p>This was a good book but I think I&#8217;m in a different stage of my business, so it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;great.&#8221; The first half of it I am already very familiar with. The second half I haven&#8217;t gotten to yet. Bummer. </p>
<p>Regardless, there is always a lot to learn from Chris Ducker, an all-around well-known and influential guy to follow on a regular basis. It may be just what you need to read at this moment, especially if you are preparing to launch any product, course, etc.</p>
<p>One key takeaway is to be sure that YOU are the brand. That way you can shift around your focus and niche and people will continue to follow because they are ultimately following YOU. </p>
<p>This is the age of the Youpreneur. Read up and see.</p>

<p><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Design is a Job by Mike Monteiro</b></a></p>
<p class="textcenter">											<a href="https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job" data-elementor-open-lightbox="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><br />

<p>One of the many great books offered from &#8216;A Book Apart.&#8217; Mike Monteiro answers all the questions that no one else is answering from the outset with a lot of personal business examples to back it all up. From finding clients, to getting comfortable talking about money, to contracts, to the art of presenting your work to clients, handling feedback, etc., all of it is highly practical and I learned a ton that I will continue to reference down the road.</p>
<p>The best part of the book is that it&#8217;s real, no fluff. All of it comes from his many years in web design, the good and the bad.</p>
<h2>Courses Taken in April 2018</h2>
<p>No courses finished this month. Bummer.</p>
<p>However&#8230;..note the word &#8216;finished.&#8217; I am in progress with some, just not finished, so you will have to tune into next month&#8217;s report to see what they are.</p>
