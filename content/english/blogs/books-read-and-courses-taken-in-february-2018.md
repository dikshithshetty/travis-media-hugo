<p>I love looking through lists of what other creatives are reading and learning. I believe wholeheartedly that as coders, developers, freelancers, entrepreneurs, teachers, etc., that we should be regularly learning and educating ourselves.</p>
<p>Thus, I decided I would start contributing my list of books and courses each month in an effort to stir up others the same way I feel stirred when I read through these lists.</p>
<p>So look for these posts at the beginning of each month and let me know in the comments if you do the same or have a recommendation of good blogs or lists to follow to do this.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The month of February was a busy one, and as usual, short, but I was able to fit in six books and complete one online course via Udemy. Here are the results:</p>
<h2>Books Read In February 2018</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2FSzUcN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad: <em>What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money &#8211; That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not! </em></strong></a>by Robert Kiyosaki</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m the only one that hadn&#8217;t read this book. It was great, though I have to agree with many that while it provided very thought-provoking information, it was lacking in any practicality. Yet, I think the subsequent books in this series are aimed at taking care of that so no problem.</p>
<p>Overall, a wonderful book with one key theme: <strong>Make it a high priority in your life to become <a href="http://www.richdad.com/Resources/Rich-Dad-Financial-Education-Blog/August-2012/what-is-financial-literacy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financially literate</a>. </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2oJzmyL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The War of Art </strong></a>by Steven Pressfield</p>

<p>A huge letdown. Not because its a bad book, but because it did not at all live up to its hype. I mean this book is idolized by so many.</p>
<p>Now while some content is helpful, I can&#8217;t get past the writing style/chapter layouts. It&#8217;s just annoying. For this reason, I didn&#8217;t care for &#8220;Do the Work&#8221; either. Perhaps I&#8217;ll give it another shot down the road.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2thfXcV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Investing for Beginners: <em>Simple Investing Guide to Become an Intelligent Investor</em></strong></a> by Sam Sutton</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a href="http://amzn.to/2thfXcV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br />
<img src="/images/2019/12/investing-for-beginners.jpg" alt="investing for beginners book" width="313" height="500" /> </a></p>
<p>This was free with Kindle Unlimited, so I picked it up and it was a good refresh on investing.</p>
<p>In its 43 pages, there is nothing new per se, but there is some solid, foundational advice and core concepts that anyone new-ish to investing would definitely benefit from.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2oP2944" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Rich20Something:</strong> <em><strong>Ditch Your Average Job, Start an Epic Business, and Score the Life You Want</strong></em> </a>by Daniel DiPiazza</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a href="http://amzn.to/2oP2944" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br />
<img src="/images/2019/12/rich-20-something.jpg" alt="rich 20 something daniel dipiazza book" width="315" height="475" /> </a></p>
<p>This is the book of the month, and one of the best I&#8217;ve read in a while in regards to being real and practical about starting or growing a business.</p>
<p>Daniel DiPiazza offers really helpful advice and wisdom on starting a business, growing it (with really unique examples), building your network (and developing yourself) and taking full advantage of this great time we live in. I&#8217;ve read a number of books on this subject and this is by far the most helpful. There are some solid boots on these feet.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2tdxmDC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Mark, the Match Boy</strong></a> (#3 The Ragged Dick Series) by Horatio Alger</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a href="http://amzn.to/2tdxmDC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br />
<img src="/images/2019/12/mark-the-match-boy.png" alt="mark the match boy alger book" width="412" height="588" /> </a></p>
<p>This is the third book in the Ragged Dick series, a sequence of stories about the lives of capitalist street boys in late 19 century New York City, who choose to rise up and make something better of their situation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading these to the kids and each one has been a delight. In this third story, Mark the Match Boy (his profession) leaves an abusive caretaker and meets up with Ragged Dick (now a successful businessman) who helps him rise to a better life.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2tdxmDC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Rough and Ready</strong></a> (#4 The Ragged Dick Series) by Horatio Alger</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a href="http://amzn.to/2tdxmDC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"></p>
<img src="/images/2019/12/rough-and-ready.jpg" alt="rough and ready alger book" width="333" height="499" /> </a></p>
<p>Book #4 in the Ragged Dick series, and another exciting story for the kids (and myself, as I think I may enjoy them more!).</p>
<p>Rufus (or Rough &amp; Ready as his street name) an entrepreneurial newsboy escapes with his younger sister from an abusive, drunken step-father, and vows to set up a better life for them even though this step-father does not let it happen so easily. Exciting stuff, and as always great lessons learned, both morally and fiscally.</p>

<h2>Courses Taken in February 2018</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/affinity-designer-the-complete-guide-to-affinity-designer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Affinity Designer</strong>: <em><strong>The Complete Guide to Affinity Designer</strong></em> </a>by Jeremy Hazel</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a href="https://www.udemy.com/affinity-designer-the-complete-guide-to-affinity-designer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-elementor-open-lightbox="default"><br />
<img src="/images/2019/12/Affinity-Designer-Udemy-Course.png" alt="" width="562" height="480" /> </a></p>
<p>You may have noticed more custom graphics on my site. In an effort to strengthen my &#8220;design skills&#8221; I took this lengthy course on Affinity Designer, my tool of choice for vector graphics.</p>
<p>I had taken another Affinity Designer course on Udemy, and one on a Pluralsight trial, and I can say this one blows both out of the water. It is comprehensive AND very thorough and well taught. I would recommend this as THE course for anyone looking to get acquainted with Affinity Designer or looking for an Illustrator alternative.</p>
<p>Kudos Jeremy Hazal!</p>
