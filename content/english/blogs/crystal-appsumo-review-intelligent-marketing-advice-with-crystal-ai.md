<p><img data-rjs="2" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-featured-image.jpg" /></p>
<p>What exactly is Crystal.ai and how can it benefit you? As it is currently on AppSumo, I want to help you understand in this Crystal AppSumo Review.</p>
<p>To be honest, I could not quite tell exactly what Crystal.ai was from the AppSumo page.</p>
<p>Is it just Siri? Do I <strong>have</strong> to talk to it? Can I type? Is there a dashboard?How will this benefit me?</p>
<p>Given that it&rsquo;s $99/month normally, it should be providing some sort of value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And given that AppSumo is offering a <a href="/recommends/crystal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lifetime, Premium, offer</a> on this, I need to look into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a while since I have posted an AppSumo review, simply because I don&rsquo;t need the majority of products on there. But this one looked promising, REAL promising from the outset. AND, there is a mobile app already for iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my Crystal AppSumo review to help you decide whether it might be for you.</p>
<h2 id="tab-con-7">Crystal AppSumo Review &ndash; Crystal.ai</h2>
<h5 id="tab-con-9"><u>A Fun &amp; Detailed Walkthrough Video</u></h5>
<p>If you prefer a video review and walkthrough then here you go. Otherwise, continue reading for the detailed blog post.&nbsp;</p>

{{< youtube _NRdRAmMhNE >}}

<h5 id="tab-con-13"><u>Or you can read all about it:</u></h5>
<p>Given that AppSumo <a href="/recommends/crystal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">already has a post</a> describing what it is, in this review I simply want to take you on the inside and show you its features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll begin by going across the main tabs at the top as seen here.</p>
<h3 id="tab-con-12">The Advisor</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review advisor menu" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-advisor-menu.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The Advisor is where you ASK or WRITE a question. Did you get that? You can <strong>ask</strong>, and she will answer. And you can <strong>write</strong>, and she will answer via text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the AI here is fantastic. I mean, how many sources do have to visit to gather this much information? With Crystal, you can do it all in one place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some example questions you can ask Crystal:</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal-appsumo-review-questions-2" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-questions-2.png" /></p>
<p>Loaded! And what if you are running a Twitter or a Facebook ad campaign?</p>
<p>You can check all your stats there as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal-appsumo-review-questions-1" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-questions-1.png" style=""></p>
<p>These questions pull data not only from your Social Media sources, including your ad campaigns, but also your Google Analytics data, and in my own testing:</p>
<ul class=""><li class="">the answers are accurate and up to date</li>
<li class="">the data is retrieved obnoxiously fast</li>
<li class="">the speech recognition of Crystal is very good (coming from a guy that was in the speech recognition field for 8 years)</li>
</ul><p>You can also connect your WooCommerce and pull its data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for the outset of this Crystal AppSumo review, I am super excited about this product.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="tab-con-14">Analytics</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review analytics menu" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-analytics-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Next up in this Crystal AppSumo Review we&rsquo;ll look at the next tab, Analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a big one for me and answered my question, &ldquo;is there a dashboard where I can get an overview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sure is. Here is a shot of my scanty YouTube analytics:</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review analytics" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-analytics.png" style=""></p>
<p>Checking my Google Analytics, Twitter, and other options, they are also accurate, up-to-date, and best of all&hellip;.all in one place!</p>
<h3 id="tab-con-10">Reports</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review reports menu" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-reports-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Next in the Crystal AppSumo review, we will look at the Crystal.ai Reports section.</p>
<p>Here, you create your own custom reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You name it -> choose your platform -> and add your desired metrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a report again of my scanty YouTube Channel with only three metrics chosen out of 11. Each platform has its own amount of differing metrics</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review reports" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-reports.jpg" style=""></p>
<h3 id="tab-con-1">Publisher</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review publisher menu" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-publisher-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Now this next section in our Crystal AppSumo review is very, very interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, you can publish and schedule posts (or videos) to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube!</p>
<p>You can create new posts, schedule them at either a custom time or use the Crystal.ai &ldquo;Genius Mode&rdquo; to suggest the best time, and you can see you content AND your calendar of your scheduled posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo posting" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-posting.png" /><img class="" alt="crystal appsumo review calendar" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-calendar.png" style=""><img alt="crystal appsumo review content" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-content.png" /></p>
<p>Very neat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll be utilizing this feature at this point, but it&rsquo;s great to have.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="tab-con-2">Campaigns</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review campaigns menu" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-campaigns-menu.png" /></p>
<p>In this section, you can view your Facebook, Twitter, and AdWords campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a current campaign I started. I can view the budget, the CPM, and even pause the campaign from this screen!</p>
<p>I asked Crystal how it was doing and she told me it had been clicked 7 times.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal_appsumo_review_campaigns_1" src="/images/2019/12/crystal_appsumo_review_campaigns_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>A nice feature!</p>
<h3 id="tab-con-3">Connector</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review connector menu" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-connector-menu.png" /></p>
<p>And last in this Crystal AppSumo review, is the Connector tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is essentially where you will connect all your platforms. Note that the LinkedIn connector is for LinkedIn Pages only.</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="crystal appsumo review connector" src="/images/2019/12/crystal-appsumo-review-connector.png" style=""></p>
<h2 id="tab-con-4">Overall Features Currently on AppSumo</h2>
<ul class=""><li class="">Lifetime access to the Crystal Premium plan</li>

</ul><h2 id="tab-con-5">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Crystal.ai software is very nice already, and looks more promising in the days to come, especially with its Machine Learning focus and the fact that it is programmed to get smarter in regards to your data over time.&nbsp;</p>
