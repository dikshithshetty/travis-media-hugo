title:  "How I Got My First 2 Freelance Clients"

---


<p>It can be a daunting task&#8230;.looking for your first 2 freelance clients. I prepared a bit by reading a lot on the subject. While this was helpful, it also gave me an excuse for not getting out and finding them myself. I wasn&#8217;t ready&#8230;I just needed to study a bit more about the subject until I felt confident.</p>
<p>Well, we know how that goes&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyways, I decided in the meantime to try some obvious and &#8220;comfortable&#8221; places in order to find my first 2 freelance clients.</p>
<h3>Client #1</h3>
<p>First, I put an ad on Craigslist. Yes, Craigslist!</p>
<p>You see, when one starts something new, the biggest problem they face is the lack of evidence or proof that they know what they are doing. I have a couple of apps and sites that I build at <a href="http://bloc.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloc</a>, but nothing really I could present in which I worked with someone else on a professional level to achieve an end result that I could show off to potential clients.</p>
<p>Thus, the present goal was to find a couple of clients, work for sub-par pay, do an over-the-top job, and in return get a great testimonial, a nice portfolio story, and possible future business.</p>
<p>So I put an ad out for a free website design/setup&#8230;&#8230;and I got a response.</p>
<p>The response was from a guy who owns a local sports and fitness center. His business was doing good but his website was very outdated and unappealing. I have talked to him a couple of times and am in the process of getting a copy of his site on my local machine and working to get more media from him.</p>
<h3>Client #2</h3>
<p>Second, I created a profile on <a href="/6-types-upwork-job-listings-you-should-skip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upwork</a>. Upwork is a site providing work for freelancers or providing freelancers for your work. The perks: There are lots of jobs posted all day, every day. The disadvantage: They take a good cut of the money (I think 20%).</p>
<p>Anyways, I put a proposal out there with a client looking for someone to redesign his counseling website. He contacted me for more info and chose me for the job. Sure, it was only a $300 job, but like I stated above, the goal is not the money but the testimonial and portfolio story, something to prove to future clients of my capability to meet their needs.</p>
<p>This project is going well. I copied his site to my local comp and have been in regular contact with him and have made some significant and stunning changes to the site. He is happy, I am happy, and I am certain that this will end well for both of us.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>What are my next steps? Well, to complete the two projects for my first 2 freelance clients, update my portfolio and stay pushing ahead to obtain more freelance clients. Stay tuned for future updates.</p>
