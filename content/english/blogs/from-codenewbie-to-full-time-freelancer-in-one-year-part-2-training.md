<h2>Part 2: Training</h2>
<p>So I ended <a href="/from-codenewbie-to-full-time-freelancer-part-1-the-beginnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my previous post</a> with the resolution to learn to code and build websites via an online bootcamp. I chose this medium because I felt there would be more value and resolve in something that I put money into as opposed to free. </p>
<p>For anyone who has looked into online coding bootcamps before, you can attest to this: It can be exhausting because there are so many, so many options, so many &#8220;pitches.&#8221; Some are very intense, some more relaxed, some expensive, and others more affordable. </p>
<h2>Bloc</h2>
<p>I <a href="/the-why-of-this-pursuit">settled with Bloc&#8217;s Part-Time Web Developer Track</a> for my training. The <a href="https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part-time track</a> requires about 20 hours a week which fit well with my full-time job. Also, it did not require that you be a coding guru already like some of the other bootcamps. </p>
<p>Overall, everything about Bloc was a positive experience: My mentor was very helpful, the courses thorough, and they really challenged me to work things out on my own. It was a very rewarding trek and this training gave me a strong foundation by which to ground my coding journey. </p>
<p>That being said, I dropped out at the outset of the Back-End portion of the course, which is about the mid-point. (Whats with all the hype about Ruby &amp; Ruby on Rails? Meh). This had nothing to do with Bloc. It instead had to do with: 1. My strong preference for Front End Development over Back End; 2. My newfound annoyance with TDD, Test Driven Development (I understand the benefits, but I can&#8217;t help feeling that overall it just doubles the work); 3. And since I knew that I wanted to focus on Front End (CSS/JS/Angular, etc.), I could stop now and get half of my tuition reimbursed, cha-ching! </p>
<p>Thus, I ended my time at Bloc.</p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>At this point I began to consider the workplace&#8230;.what is my next step in getting a job in this field? As I began to explore my options I became very interested in the world of freelance. I&#8217;ve worked my entire adult life in cubicles and felt that if I was starting fresh in a new career, why not go all out? </p>
<p>So what demand is out there for Front End freelancers? WordPress? Wait, I have been using WordPress for a few years now anyways and love it. Oh, and I now understand CSS and JavaScript! </p>
<p>Thus, I decided to focus exclusively on WordPress development due to the large volume of people and companies who use it. </p>
<p>And, at that point I kept running across these irresistible ads from a company called <a href="https://skillcrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skillcrush</a> stating they can take me through a WordPress developer course, targeted for aspiring freelancers. After some research (and confirming that they were not an &#8220;all-girls&#8221; bootcamp), I signed up for the Freelance WordPress Developer Blueprint course&#8230;. Just take my money please!</p>
<h2>Skillcrush</h2>
<p>The blueprint package I chose included Front End Development, WordPress Development, and Web Design. I must admit that I did not go through the course properly in the 3 month layout, but jumped straight to the WordPress development blueprint (I will revisit this in a later post). </p>
<p>This blueprint was EXACTLY what I needed to get my mind around the structure of the WordPress CMS, and I am thankful I took this course (and I get lifetime access to it!).</p>
<p>I learned the overall structure, template tags, basic PHP, custom post types, how to integrate advanced custom fields, best practices and workflow, how to begin freelancing with WordPress, etc., etc.</p>
<p>An invaluable investment in my opinion (and again, yes men you can sign up&#8230;).</p>
<p>At this point, now that I had a solid foundation to build on, I felt confident to move forward with WordPress development, and more specifically &#8220;Freelance&#8221; WordPress development. </p>
<p>So&#8230;..I guess my next step is to put together a website and getting myself out there? </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about that in Part 3. </p>
<p>If you have any questions for me, please ask!!</p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>Every aspiring web developer/designer needs training. HTML, CSS, and a basic understanding of JS, are required. </p>
<p>That being said, learning to code is a lifelong pursuit. You will never reach that finish line. There is a temptation to feel like you must learn &#8220;one more thing&#8221; before you can actually get out there and pursue this career. Thus, many CodeNewbies spend years learning, never reaching a point where they are &#8220;ready.&#8221; <a href="/codenewbie-when-are-you-finally-ready">More about that here</a>. </p>
<p>So look, establish a solid foundation and then step out towards your goal, and as you step out continue learning along the way.</p>
<p>Perhaps its a bootcamp, or <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Code Camp</a>, or <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a>, or <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynda.com</a>, but whatever medium you choose get yourself a solid foundation by which to build on. Once you have that foundation, step out. </p>
