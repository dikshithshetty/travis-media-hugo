<h2>Part 8: Some Final Words</h2>
<p>Well, we&#8217;ve reached the eighth and final part of my blog series on <a href="/from-codenewbie-to-full-time-freelancer-part-1-the-beginnings">becoming a full time freelancer in one year</a>, and I want to end it with some final words of encouragement to CodeNewbies in general and more specifically those who have a desire to pursue freelancing full time.</p>
<h2>As For Me&#8230;</h2>
<h4>My current State</h4>
<p>Next week is my last week with a stable and predictable income, the last week of life in a cubicle, the last week of corporate benefits such as health insurance, 401K matching, W-2 forms, etc.</p>
<p>It also begins an exciting new chapter in my life and speaking of life&#8230;I only get one of these.</p>
<p>Transitioning into this, I have lots of work coming in, a great health insurance option, and a family excited that I will be around more often.</p>
<p>However, it is a bit daunting, but a challenge I am willing to accept.</p>
<h2>As For You&#8230;</h2>
<p>In this final post, again I want to offer a few points of encouragement to CodeNewbies in general and CodeNewbies looking to get started with freelancing:</p>
<h4>Value Yourself and Your Work</h4>
<p>You have value to offer people. You will never be the best coder and will <a href="/codenewbie-when-are-you-finally-ready">never feel adequate</a> for the programming role you are in. This is mainly because the field is rapidly changing/growing and you must be constantly learning to stay in the game.</p>
<p>But, you have come a long way and there are, at all times, myriads of people looking for the skills that you offer. So don&#8217;t build $50 websites&#8230;is that your worth? Think about the value that you are bringing to people, be confident in what you charge and what you require, and then give it your best.</p>
<p>In addition, your ability to code does not have a say in who you are as a person. Remember to value yourself independent of your skillset. Find your personality and be comfortable with it. Work on your <a href="http://amzn.to/2zZEK4L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soft Skills</a> (these go much further with potential employers or clients than you might expect). Enjoy your life.</p>
<h4>#100daysofcode</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to say this for a while but just haven&#8217;t had the opportunity, so here goes:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#100daysofcode hashtag</a> on Twitter has become quite a popular pursuit. Basically, people commit to some sort of coding for 100 straight days and Tweet about it.</p>
<p>I myself love it and think its a wonderful challenge with a wonderful community of people involved.</p>
<p>However, there can be a tendency to get so caught up in the &#8220;process&#8221; that you ultimately make it nowhere.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Once I finish 100 days straight I will be more equipped to apply for that job.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Hey guys I missed three days now. Ugh. Starting Monday I recommit to a new 100 days.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Day 63. Finished my calculator and started learning PHP and React.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>All of this is great, but there comes a time where you have to be okay with missing a day and actually getting out there and interviewing for jobs. #100daysofcode can become a subconscious opportunity to hide behind the wall of perceived inadequacy.</p>
<p>There is a 99% chance that you are more than ready to meet the need of some client or employer out there. Enjoy the #100daysofcode, but don&#8217;t let it become an excuse.</p>
<h4>Watch Your Health</h4>
<p>Finally, when it comes to sitting at a computer all day we should be very conscious about the unhealthy baggage that follows. And sitting in a chair all day brings some unhealthy baggage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never okay to stay up all night coding. First, adequate sleep should be a high priority for reasons of health, productivity, sanity, emotional well-being, etc. Second, no on has a good coding mindset at 3 a.m. No one.</p>
<p>There seems to be this caricature of the coder up all night, stressed, talking to himself, on cup #10 of coffee, etc.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be that person.</p>
<p>Get a <a href="http://amzn.to/2ifsUeB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand up desk</a>. Use a <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue light filter</a>. Find time to exercise daily (you can do this in <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 7 minutes a day</a>). Get outdoors. Drink some water. Skype a friend and have a good laugh.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t devote yourself so much to a particular task that your mental and physical well-being suffer.</p>
<p>Here is a post I wrote on &#8220;<a href="/5-everyday-health-hacks-for-those-with-computer-jobs">5 Everyday Health Hacks For Those With Computer Jobs.</a>&#8221;</p>
<h2>Conclusion / Next Steps</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have. Hopefully this series has been helpful to you as a CodeNewbie or an aspiring freelancer. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below or send them to me in the General Contact form.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, next week is my last week in the corporate workplace. What lies ahead in the next few months is left unsaid.</p>
