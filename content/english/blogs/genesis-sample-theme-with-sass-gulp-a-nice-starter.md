<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen people ask me about a good Genesis starter theme, I now answer exclusively with &#8220;the Genesis Sample theme&#8230;..with an added Sass &amp; Gulp workflow.&#8221; I&#8217;ll share it with you in this post.</div><hr class="lead-hr">



<p>I&#8217;ve been back and forth on Genesis starter themes over the years. </p>



<p>I made one a while back with the Genesis Sample theme, again with a Sass and Gulp workflow, but over time realized I had changed up so much code and shifted so many things around that it had become more of a burden than a helper. </p>



<p>Then I came across Bill Erickson&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="new starter theme (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/billerickson/ea-genesis-child/" target="_blank">starter theme</a> and really enjoyed using it for a month or two, but it just has a bit too much going on for my taste. </p>



<p>Thus, I decided to step back a bit and simplify things. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>



<p>First, I grabbed the latest Genesis Sample theme from Studiopress (3.0). </p>



<p>Second, I decided not to change anything at all except for the assets and the workflow. That means no gutting functions.php and no creating a custom plugin, <strong><em>by default</em></strong>, to throw everything in. </p>



<p>I used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sridhar Katakam's Sass files (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/srikat/genesis-sample-task-runner" target="_blank">Sridhar Katakam&#8217;s Sass files to replace the default CSS</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, I added <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="WP Gulp (opens in a new tab)">WP Gulp</a> to incorporate a full-featured Gulp workflow</p>



<p>So if you are looking for a nice, simple, Sassified, Gulp-driven Genesis Starter theme to begin your projects with, this one is simple to use and based off of the latest and greatest Genesis Sample theme. </p>
