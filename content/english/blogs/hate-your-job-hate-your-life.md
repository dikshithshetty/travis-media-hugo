<blockquote><p>“People usually underestimate the influence of their career on their overall wellbeing. But Career Wellbeing is arguably the most essential of the five elements. If you don’t have the opportunity to regularly do something you enjoy—even if it’s more of a passion or interest than something you get paid to do—the odds  of your having high wellbeing in other areas diminish rapidly. People with high Career Wellbeing are more than twice as likely to be thriving in their lives overall.” (<a href="http://amzn.to/2oQzkmX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Rath &amp; Jim Harter</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e spend large chunks of our day to day life at work. We spend much more time at our jobs than we do at home. We spend more time with our co-workers and bosses than we do our own families.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: Our satisfaction or dissatisfaction that we find in our careers will leak (or flood) its way into our personal lives.</p>
<p>If we hate our jobs then more than likely we are dissatisfied in life. And life happens so fast&#8230;. why waste another day? Hate your job, hate your life!</p>
<p>If you are dissatisfied at work, and you are there for 40 hours every week, it inevitably will have a negative effect on your life. In addition, your daily goal will be to &#8220;get through it&#8221; so that you can get back to the things you love.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate.</p>
<p>This is <strong>common!</strong></p>
<p>Well, we have to work to eat. Yes! And be thankful that you have a job. But do not let that be your ending point.</p>
<h3>Complacency</h3>
<p>In 2007 I moved back to the area in which I grew up. I took a temp job just for money while I was getting settled. I took it because I needed money and it was an easy job. Ten years later I am still here!!</p>
<p>Why am I still here?</p>
<p>Because I got complacent. I never meant to be here for more than a year. But it was easy work, the hours were good, I &#8220;moved up&#8221; a little each year, and life was happening.</p>
<p>Now I am 35. Ugh.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>Currently, the position I am in is repetitive, unmotivating, and provides no more opportunity for advancement. My life is invigorating outside of work, but my time at work is dull, stagnant, and a &#8216;hate your job&#8217; outlook.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Well, time to put a plan together. In fact, the <a href="/after-being-outsourced-time-for-major-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ball has been rolling</a> the past few months and I am<a href="/first-2-freelance-clients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> gradually working my way out</a> of this into work that I love. &#8216;Hate your job&#8217; no longer. Yes sir!</p>
<p>Kristen Webb Wright of iThemes <a href="http://amzn.to/2nKTehs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it this way</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How may chronically unhappy, miserable people do you know who just absolutely love their job?</strong></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t answer that question. Neither can I.</p>
<p>They go hand in hand!</p>
<p>So what do you do if you hate your job and it is affecting your life? Sure it puts food on the table. That is important. But are you motivated to get out and into a job that you love?</p>
<p>If you are, here are a five brief steps you can begin taking NOW:</p>
<h3>1. Create a plan and a timeline</h3>
<p><strong>A plan</strong>: What do you want to do? What are your skills and interests? Do you need to get some training? Do you need to take some classes? List out potential companies that you could or would want to work for. Gather the information needed for you to pursue working there in the future such as what services they provide, what tools they use, what job postings they have listed, and how you could provide benefit to them.</p>
<p><strong>A timeline</strong>: First, determine the total length of time that you want to give yourself for this transition; from today until the day that you expect to be in another career. Next, fill out the landmarks in between these two points.</p>
<p>For example, lets say you give yourself one year for this transition. Mark these two points. In between include things like, 6 months training, one month resume creation/job research, and the last five months sending out that resume to those companies your reasearched, going to interviews, and landing that job. Set landmarks within these landmarks as well. Be very specific and work hard to stay on track.</p>
<h3>2. Get some training</h3>
<p>It is the year 2017 and there are TONS of places to learn things. Now if you are looking to be a doctor, lawyer, or some profession where rigorous and standardized training is demanded, go back to school. For the rest of us, it is sufficient to get specific, informal, training in the area you are pursuing. There are a load of online &#8220;learning centers&#8221; (<a href="http://lynda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynda</a>, <a href="http://udemy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a>, etc.) as well as local colleges that offer online certificates and other forms of relatively inexpensive training.</p>
<p>What specifically do you want to do? Do not get caught up in all the added fluff, but find a program that sticks you right in the middle of what you are looking to learn.</p>
<h3>3. Start Talking To Everyone</h3>
<p>Network! Start talking to strangers. Start meeting with people. Start asking more questions. Get to know people in other departments at work. Open up your life socially. It is amazing how many people land jobs via &#8216;word of mouth&#8217; or some sort of personal connection.</p>
<h3>4. Consider Freelancing</h3>
<p>A freelance business can be started and grown while you work full time. What talents do you have? Are they potential services that you can provide to people in exchange for money? Is there a need in your area for your expertise? Freelancing at a basic level is just meeting people&#8217;s needs. People need things done, and you rise up and do it for them in exchange for money.</p>
<h3>5. Stay true to your personality</h3>
<p>What do I mean by this?? What does this have to do with a career change?</p>
<p>These days I have noticed that successful people, those who stand out&#8230;. have a unique personality and it comes out in everything they do. In other words, they are themselves.</p>
<p>Often when people look to change careers or look to get into fields where they do not have much past experience, they try to become people they are not.  They try to talk extra technical or with big words. They start mimicking those around them.</p>
<p>Do not lose your personality in the transition. You are you and be thrilled about that. Let it show. It is what sets you apart from everyone else.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Take a look around next time you are at Wal-Mart or the mall, or the restaurants, or even your own workplace. Take note of all of the &#8220;Monday complaints&#8221; and &#8220;Friday hype.&#8221; Your job will affect your life. Your job has affected your life.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let another day go by. Don&#8217;t hate your job any longer! Start planning now and make a change. You can do it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you hate your job or do you work a job that you love? Have you always? If not, what changes did you make and what steps did you take to get there?</strong></em></p>
