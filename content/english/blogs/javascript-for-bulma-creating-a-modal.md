<p>In this post I&#8217;ll show you how to add the JavaScript necessary for creating a Modal with Bulma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I aim to do a series of posts looking a specific elements and components in Bulma, and putting together some vanilla JavaScript needed to make these functional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you probably know, Bulma is a modern, lightweight CSS framework that aids in getting your websites built faster and more efficiently. The reason that it is lightweight is that it includes NO JAVASCRIPT!</p>
<p>So the components are there, but just need a little JavaScript to make them work. Hence, this post.</p>
<p>So we will look today at creating a Modal in Bulma and what JavaScript is necessary to make it work.&nbsp;</p>
