<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">A</span> year ago I tried to learn Docker but just wasn't ready for it. The tutorials I tried to follow were too comprehensive and "theory-based."</div>

A year later I looked back and decided I would make a tutorial that would have been much more beneficial for me then.

In this video, we'll take a fun dive into Docker, learn some definitions, dockerize some apps, push them to Docker Hub, and deploy them to Digital Ocean.
