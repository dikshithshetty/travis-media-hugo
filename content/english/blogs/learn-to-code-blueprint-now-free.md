<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s of today, January 20, 2020, my 6-month, Learn to Code Blueprint Course is now completely FREE! In this post, I'll share how to you can get enrolled and on your way to a successful 2020. </div>
<hr class="lead-hr">

In 2020 I want to see more people learn to code, become confident developers, and succeed in changing careers or landing their first dev job.

When I created the Learn to Code Blueprint course, I wanted to do things a bit differently.

I wanted to:

* Provide a step-by-step, week-by-week blueprint that takes a student from a complete CodeNewbie to confidently applying for jobs by utilizing hand-picked resources from around the web blended with my own teaching. No need to re-invent the wheel.
* Provide real world projects for students to work on and examples of real life scenarios to build confidence.
* Provide a rock-solid foundational base before moving on to coding specialties.
* Allowing the student to choose a speciality later in the course based on their interest or demand in their city.
* Finally, to focus at the end on building a project portfolio, building an informative resume, and confidently applying for that dev job.

This course was never offered for free. Sometimes I would discount it, but overall I felt there was a lot of value here.

And I still believe in the value of this course. 

I STILL believe that any student who stays the course and learns the material WILL land that first dev job or career change.

That is what I want to see in 2020, so I'm moving the price down to FREE. Free for ANYONE to take.

## How Do I Enroll In The Course?

Well, first you need to watch the intro video. This will tell you all about the course and how to succeed at it.
