<p>Are you learning to code, or considering learning to code, but feel that you may be too old? You&#8217;re not! Learning to Code later in life actually has it&#8217;s benefits.</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img data-rjs="2" title="learning to code later in life" src="/images/2019/12/learning-to-code-later-in-life.jpg" alt="learning to code later in life" /></p>
<p>I felt this way in 2016 when I decided I would learn to code. I was 35 and married with 4 children. Other than a WordPress blog that I maintained, I had no experience with coding&#8230;at all! And my Twitter feeds were full of early 20-somethings learning web development and discussing topics that I had absolutely no knowledge of.</p>
<p>But two years later, here I am and coding has become an integral part of my life. I was actually able to leave my 9-5 and pursue freelance web development full time. You can <a href="/ebooks#fl-ebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read all about my journey here</a> if that interests you.</p>
<p>But all this is to say, that not only are you NOT too old to learn to code, but there are some <strong>valuable benefits</strong> to doing so at this stage of your life.</p>
<p>Your cup is half full.</p>
<p>In fact, here are 5 immediate benefits to learning to code later in life:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">5 Benefits of Learning To Code Later In Life</h2>
<h3>1. Economics</h3>
<p>Time is one thing in life that becomes more and more scarce as you get older. You can&#8217;t get back lost time. &nbsp;If you spent your 20&#8217;s working at Wal-Mart for $10/hr instead of moving up the pay ladder, then you have wasted time in increasing your salary and long-term savings.</p>
<p>Coding is one field that pays well. By learning to code, you can increase your $10/hour salary quite significantly in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to obtain a drastic increase in your pay, make up for lost time, and increase your overall quality of life.</p>
<h3>2. Utilizing Prior Experience</h3>
<p>This one is obvious: You are not coming to a new field as an overall complete newbie, but as a complete newbie with lots of real world experience.</p>
<p>Your 10 years at Wal-Mart taught you customer service, time management, organizational skills, and more.</p>
<p>Whatever your 20&#8217;s were spent doing, you gained lots of experience that the youngster doesn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>Remember, you are already ahead in many aspects&#8230;.you just need to <a href="/ebooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn to code</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Staying Relevant</h3>
<p>Another wonderful thing about learning to code later in life, is that you are forced to stay relevant in the world of tech. This prevents you from become that &#8220;older guy&#8221; who begrudgingly still uses a flip phone and blames everything on &#8220;kids these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you get into coding, you will inevitably become enamored with all the wonderful things happening in the vast world of technology today.</p>
<p>This will force you to stay relevant in life, a topic I plan to revisit in the future.</p>
<h3>4. Mental Health</h3>
<p>Solving coding challenges, building apps, debugging, etc. forces you to put your brain to work.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that mentally challenging activities like computer programming help to form new neural connections while strengthening exists ones.</p>
<p>There have been links to other potential benefits such as improved memory, delayed onset of dementia/Alzheimer&#8217;s, increased attention to detail, increased productivity, etc.</p>
<p>As we get older, our brains tend to slow down. By learning to code later in life, you are indirectly committing to keeping your brain sharp and your mental health optimized.</p>
<h3>5. Many Options</h3>
<p>The field of tech and programming is so, so vast and is growing and changing so rapidly.</p>
<p>This allows you to pursue MANY avenues and specialities. Do you want to build websites? Software applications? Handle large amounts of data? Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning? Healthcare technology? Geoscience? &#8230;.and on and on.</p>
<p>This not only gives you lots of options, but also provides you the opportunity to take your past specialty and experience and pursue programming in that particular field and niche.</p>
<h4>Now, a few words of advice&#8230;</h4>
<p>Hopefully you see now that there are wonderful benefits to learning to code, and you should not let an age barrier stop you in any way from doing so.</p>
<p>However, if you choose this path, you will face a number of potential obstacles, the majority of which are in only in your head.</p>
<p>So if you are learning to code later in life or considering it, let me give you a few pointers:</p>
<ul class="">
<li class="">Don&#8217;t be discouraged by the young eggheads whose sole mission is to make you feel stupid for asking normal questions. Move on and pay them no regard.</li>
<li class="">Since you did squander your 20&#8217;s, don&#8217;t let yourself get sidetracked with all the courses and amazing new things out there. Strictly define your goals, and stick to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qHC_5FVtBhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch this video on how exactly you can learn to code and get a job in only six months&#8230;and why most people fail to do it this fast</a>.</li>
<li class="">Find <a href="/find-your-specific-calling-web-based-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what you like to do</a> as fast as you can, and pursue that specific path. Do you like building websites? Learn HTML, CSS, PHP and JS. Do you like data science? Learn Python or R. After a little time of learning to code, evaluate as to what you like the most. Then specialize in the tools needed to do this effectively. Full speed ahead.</li>
<li class="">Be transparent. Unashamedly ask for help. And find others who are learning to code too. You will learn twice as fast with others than without.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hopefully you see now that it is not only possible to learn to code later in life, but there are immediate benefits to doing so.</p>
<p>I did it, and you can as well.</p>
