<p>Looking to build a website with Mezzanine CMS? This thorough Mezzanine tutorial will give you a hands-on look at this WordPress-like, content management system.</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img data-rjs="2" alt="mezzanine tutorial" src="/images/2019/12/mezzanine-cms-courses-image.jpg" /></p>
<p>A while back I started learning Python and this soon progressed to Python web frameworks like Django and Flask.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In learning these frameworks, I worked through a number of tutorials including one on building out a blog (on both Django and Flask).</p>
<p>While these frameworks are great for building web apps, they are not so efficient when it comes to building blogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because you have to manually build out the functionalities of many of the core features like: Blog posts, Tags, Categories, Forms, Featured images, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming from a WordPress background where these things are there by default!!, this seemed a tad like reinventing the wheel in regards to blogs in the year 2018!.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I understand that there&#8217;s a tradeoff when it comes to being able to work in the language or framework you love, but wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Django had these features available out of the box (if desired)?</p>
<h3>Enter Mezzanine..</h3>
<p>I then came across Mezzanine, which is exactly this!</p>
<p><strong>Mezzanine is an open-source, content management system (like WordPress), built on Python and the Django framework. </strong></p>
<p>It can be used as a standalone blog or can be added onto an existing Django project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can even import your WordPress data into it for simple migration!</p>
<h3>Why a Complete Course on Mezzanine?</h3>
<p>Aside from it being a great blogging framework, there is a deficiency out there on tutorials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the docs (which are pretty good), most of the tutorials out there (not many) are 4+ years old and are not providing a thorough overview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, I decided to create an updated, thorough, Mezzanine tutorial based on what I have learned.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Key Benefits</h3>
<p>What makes Mezzanine so efficient, is that it offers many features <strong>right out of the box, like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Models and Views &#8211; Blog posts, Pages, Blog lists/detail, Tags, Categories, Dates, Features images, Media library, Forms, etc. are already setup for you from the outset.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Templates &#8211; Mezzanine has around 45 templates available that you can pull into your project and customize as needed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>SEO friendly &#8211; meta tags, keywords, descriptions, etc. are there for you to update.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Inline page editing &#8211; Edit content right there on the front end of the page.</li>
<li>Built in integration with Twitter, Akismet, Google Analytics, and more.</li>
<li>A powerful Admin area with widgets that can be customized.</li>
<li><a href="http://mezzanine.jupo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And many more</a>&#8230;.</li>
</ul>
