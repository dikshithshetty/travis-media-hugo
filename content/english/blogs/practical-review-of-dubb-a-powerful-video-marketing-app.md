<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">V</span>ideo marketing is not only the future, but the present. There is a new app called Dubb that I am thrilled to introduce. Read on for my review of Dubb and how I'm using it to change how I do email marketing.</div>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, in 2018 people just don&#8217;t have the attention spans, or the time, to read through all your email text. If so, it&#8217;s a scan, not a read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I came across <a href="/recommends/dubb2019" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dubb</a>, a lightbulb really went off for me&#8230;.</p>
<p>What if I were to send my email list <strong>videos</strong><em>instead of text</em>, and that video have a call to action to my post, or review, or whatever I am telling them to check out?</p>
<p>But it would have to be an easily accessible video with a single click and it has to be personal and engaging.</p>
<p>So when Dubb popped up as a lifetime deal in AppSumo I had to look into it, and sure enough it met the criteria&#8230;and more.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Dubb?</h3>
<p>Dubb is an all in one video marketing solution that allows you to engage clients, customers, etc. via personalized, actionable, custom videos</p>
<p>According to the AppSumo article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dubb helps you create and share <strong>conversion-driving screen recordings and live and prerecorded videos</strong> without any specialized equipment, software, or technical skills.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Email Marketing?</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I wanted to use this to market to my email list. However, I use ConvertFox for an email provider and Dubb does not (yet) support this.</p>
<p>So after playing with the app a couple of days, I found out some great features that will allow it to be used essentially with ANY e-mail provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with sharing this info in the video below, I also put together a practical walkthrough and tried to answer questions that many on the fence about Dubb may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the video review of Dubb</p>
