title:  "A Resume Template for Software Developers to Help You Land the Job"

---

<div class="lead-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">C</span>reating a concise, yet impactful, resume is very important in landing your first, or next, developer job. Here&#8217;s a look at my own, personal resume template for software developers and how I use it.</div><hr class="lead-hr">



<p>There are hundreds of resume templates out there to download, from fancy to basic.</p>



<p>Whatever you choose, you want your words to count. You want to fit the most relevant info you can muster onto one page. </p>



<p>When I went through my recent job search I came up with a pretty basic template for a resume that I used for all applications.</p>



<p>On one page I was able to summarize:</p>



<ul><li>Who I was and what I am passionate about</li><li>What value I could bring to the company</li><li>My past education</li><li>Contact details (including my Github repo)</li><li>My online presence</li><li>Hard Skills </li><li>Soft Skills</li><li>A professional photo</li><li>My location</li></ul>



<p>I felt this was sufficient to create a well-rounded, yet brief, resume template for Software Developers to land the job, including myself. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what it looked like (and yes I&#8217;ve made some of the data fictititous):</p>



<figure class="textcenter"><img src="/images/2019/12/resume-template-for-software-developers-screenshot.jpg" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Below I&#8217;ll provide a link to my resume template so you can open it up and replace it with your own data, but let me briefly explain what each section aims to do:</p>



<h2>Main Section</h2>



<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>



<p>This section should only be about 2-3 paragraphs and should include:</p>



<ol><li>Who you are and what you do</li><li>What value you would bring to the company</li><li>A desire for further discussion about the job</li></ol>



<p><strong>Work History</strong></p>



<p>Only post relevant jobs. If you were a developer in a past or current role, then put that at the top. If you worked a non-developer job, but there are skills there that apply positively to this job, include it. </p>



<p>If you worked a job that is totally unrelated and not valuable in landing this job, don&#8217;t include it. </p>



<p><strong>Education</strong></p>



<p>Be sure to include relevant education. If you graduated from college, no matter the degree, include it. Also be sure to include &#8220;unaccredited&#8221; online coding bootcamps, certificates, and pursuits as these are almost equally important these days.</p>



<p><strong>Online</strong></p>



<p>Be sure to provide a Twitter and LinkedIn feed if you have them, especially if you are active in the coding community. If you don&#8217;t include it, they will find it anyway. Better to save them some time. </p>



<h2>Sidebar Section</h2>



<p><strong>Contact Details</strong></p>



<p>Include your:</p>



<ol><li>Primary phone number (probably your cell phone)</li><li>Some type of video-conferencing platform like Skype</li><li>A primary email address</li><li>Your GitHub repo</li></ol>



<p><strong>Hard Skills</strong></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s where you dish out your coding abilities, the languages you know, and coding related talents. </p>



<p>Be sure to only list skills you can back up.</p>



<p><strong>Soft Skills</strong></p>



<p>This is where you can shine in &#8220;non-coding but job-related&#8221; soft skills. Many of us are trying to land that first developer job and have had only non-developer jobs in the past. </p>



<p>Well, the skills you picked up there are still very valuable. Skills like problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, punctuality, etc. can all be listed here. But try to tie them into the position you are pursuing. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>And that&#8217;s the gist of it: A resume template for Software Developers.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t overthink it. Make your point. Send it out by the dozens. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the template (I use Open Office, which is a free open source knock-off of Microsoft Word):</p>
