<p style="text-align: left;">Sam Gary Johnson (of 4C LTD) is a man of many hats. He is a Counselor, a Coach, and a Consultant, with an array of specialities and certifications. Sam contacted me to redesign his website. Looking at the website, we decided to ditch the free WordPress theme he was using and go with a newly designed, customized WordPress theme that would run on the Genesis framework.</p>
<p>Sam wanted a static, custom homepage, a page for each of his specialties (Coaching, Consulting, Counseling), a page describing his coaching packages with the ability to make payments, and a few other odds and ends.</p>
<p>Sam provided the photos, logo, copy, his brochure, and a very specific vision for his new site. We worked together closely with new concepts and ideas and it was very much a mutual effort.</p>
<p>As stated before, I built this on the Genesis Framework with custom CSS and HTML. It is mobile-friendly, responsive to devices of all sizes, and is fast loading.</p>
<p>Sam was a delight to work with and I wish him the best.</p>
