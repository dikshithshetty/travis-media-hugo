<p>So yesterday, December 12, 2016, I began what will be an intense, six month, 20+ hour a week Web Developer course with <a href="http://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>.</p>
<p>Add to this my full time job, a fairly big family (with four children all under 8), along with a number of other duties/delights, and we have the overall purpose of this blog: To document this journey and all it entails, from Course Commencement to Career Change and all things in-between.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will serve as an encouragement to those looking to take a step in this direction or those already standing in it.</p>
<p>Feel free to follow the blog. Also look for me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/travisdotmedia" target="_blank">@travisdotmedia</a>.</p>
<p>And&#8230; oh yeah&#8230; Hello World!</p>
