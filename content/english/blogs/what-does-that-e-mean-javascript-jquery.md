<p>When I first <a href="/week-five-done-and-recommendations">learned the basics of JavaScript</a>, I wasn&#8217;t told about the &#8220;e&#8221; that you often see passed as a parameter in functions.</p>
<p>Yet, I went on to learn the <a href="/aspiring-web-developer-using-wordpress">framework of WordPress</a>, PHP, etc., starting doing coding work for a couple of agencies, and every once in a while, while working on a project, I would see that little e in a script somewhere.</p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;What does that e mean in JavaScript and jQuery?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while I just ignored it.</p>
<p>But eventually I took the time to look it up, and it is a very, very informative and powerful little object.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+e+in+javascript&amp;oq=what+is+the+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l3j69i57j35i39.1857j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search Google</a> you will find many explanations and tutorials to help you out.</p>
<p>Regardless, I decided to add to the lineup with a brief, simplified video of this event object, its properties, and how it can be a very useful tool to embrace.</p>
<p>So, here it is: What does that e mean in JavaScript and jQuery?</p>
