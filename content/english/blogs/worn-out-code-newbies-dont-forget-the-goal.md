title:  "Worn Out Code Newbies, Don't Forget The Goal"

---


<p>These days my hands are full. I work full time (not coding), and on the side am in the part time web development track with <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a>. I also have four children (8 and under) and “real-life” things that must get done as well.</p>
<p>Coding can be addicting and can easily consume a large chunk of your time, your days, weeks, months. For me it has, and there are times where I am worn out from juggling it all.</p>
<p>If you are a newbie looking to transition into the web or software development realm, you are probably facing similar circumstances. You work your 8 hours of non-coding and then you try to find free time to code. Its hard.</p>
<p>Well, hear me out and let this serve as a reminder as well as an encouragement.</p>
<p>Don’t forget the goal.</p>
<p>What is the goal?</p>
<p>The goal is to replace your current daily grind of <em>not coding</em> with a job of <em>coding</em> (broadly speaking). This “let me get through my job today so I can get back to coding” is for the birds. There are others things to do that under these circumstances will never get done.</p>
<p>The goal is to remove 8 hours of your day not coding, replace those 8 hours with coding so that you can get back to your normal life.</p>
<p>It should go from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Daily non coding job: 8 hours</li>
<li>Daily duties: X hours</li>
<li>Coding time: Whatever is left after the above AND how little sleep you can get away with.</li>
</ol>
<p>To this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Daily coding job: 8 hours</li>
<li>Daily duties/hobbies: X hours</li>
</ol>
<p>Scrounging for time to code should be a temporary pursuit. It will always clash with other pursuits (relationships, family, vacations, self-discipline, etc.).</p>
<p>So keep up the good work. Press on. Remember it is a season of sacrifice that should flourish back into an even greater, normal life.</p>
