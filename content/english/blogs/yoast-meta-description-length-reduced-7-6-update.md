<p>If you&rsquo;ve added a meta description to any new blog post lately, you may have noticed that the Yoast meta description length has been reduced drastically. This change came with their latest 7.6 update.</p>
<p>I had noticed over the past few days that the snippets of my articles in Google have drastically decreased. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it then, but it sure makes sense now. Just look up some of your recent articles on Google and see how they measure up.</p>
<p>Now I know we all diligently read the changelog with every update, but in case you randomly missed this one, here it is:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="textcenter"><img alt="yoast meta description length" src="/images/2019/12/yoast-meta-description-length.jpg" style=""></span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had about six months with a liberal 320 characters, to pack in some solid keywords, etc., but it&rsquo;s now time to go back to the old 156 with this Yoast meta description length update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because Google. And when it <a href="/product/comprehensive-site-audit-reports">comes to SEO</a>, we are at the whim of Google. Your cyber-outlaw status doesn&rsquo;t credit you here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the exact length that Google has determined, we don&rsquo;t know. But it is <a href="https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/996065145443893249" target="_blank">confirmed by Google</a> that they have reduced the length of their snippets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now back to Yoast&hellip;.of course they are going to follow the lead of Google. Why continue to offer 320 characters, when Google will not show even half of it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s their own&nbsp;<a href="https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-7-6/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Good / The Bad of the Yoast Meta Description Length</h3>
<p>&hellip;and more importantly the Google snippet length&hellip;</p>
<p>The Good: Well, you have to follow the lead of Google. This demonstrates, again, Yoast&rsquo;s commitment to staying relevant and keeping his plugin updated accordingly (except for that <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/yoast-founder-apologizes-over-seo-plugin-bug-affected-search-rankings-2686839" target="_blank">last blunder</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bad: We&rsquo;ve had about six months of publishing posts with longer, well-crafted, meta descriptions, that now are either cut-off mid-sentence, mid-thought, or no longer includes our keyword.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no good.</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>Go with the flow and stick to 156 characters. If they up it again, just stick to 156 characters.</p>
<p>Oh and when you get time, go and adjust your previous six months of meta descriptions.</p>
