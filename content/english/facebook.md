<h3>HELLO FACEBOOK!</h3>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Travis.Media</strong>, a hub for all things involving web development, web design, freelancing, WordPress, Blogging, and simply conquering life!</p>
<p>By way of a quick introduction, my name is Travis Rodgers and in the course of <b>one year </b>I was able to learn how to code and step out of my 9 to 5 desk job into the freelance world of Web Development. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reading about my journey, step-by-step how I did it, and the lessons I learned along the way, you can <b><a href="https://travis.media/ebooks">grab my free ebook</a>. </b></p>
<h3>&#8230;but as mentioned</h3>
<p>Here is the signup for my <b>FREE email course</b>, 20 Minute Methods &#8211; JavaScript. </p>
<p>[cp_popup display=&#8221;inline&#8221; style_id=&#8221;3749&#8243; step_id = 1][/cp_popup]</p>
<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
<p>One trait of a good developer is a person that can write code, not copy and paste it only. Or at least doing the former much more than the latter.</p>
<p>I was a copy and paste developer for a long time, relying heavily on Stack Overflow code that I would snatch and then alter to meet the conditions of my own purposes.</p>
<p>Now I’m not saying you can’t do this, but you should reach a point where you can produce a lot of code from scratch, talking through it out loud and actually “writing code.”</p>
<p>So in an effort to get better at typing code without looking everything up, AND in an effort to become better acquainted with the syntax and methods of JavaScript, I created this blueprint.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive 3 emails a week over the course of 12 weeks starting this coming Monday at 7 a.m.. You should devote 20 minutes for each of these 12 days and work through the material until you complete the 12th and final lesson. </li>
</ul>
<p>These 30 common methods include easy ones like slice, join, and indexOf, and steadily progress to the more complex methods like reduce and map. </p>
<p>So sign up now for free, and look for the first email Monday at 7 a.m. </p>
