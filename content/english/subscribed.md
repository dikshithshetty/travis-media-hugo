<p style="margin-top: 40px;">If you’re seeing this, then you made it. All the links you’re after have just been sent to your inbox. Again, if you don’t see them, check your spam folder. These email programs are kinda quirky like that.</p>



<p>If you check your spam folder and still don’t see the email, give it some time… it can take a few minutes.</p>
