<h2>Important: Website Maintenance is Essential for a Successful Website!</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Just like any software or application, websites require maintenance to keep them working properly. This is true of other things like maintenance to your car in the routine oil change, or yearly visits to your doctor to make sure you are in optimal health. Why would it not be the same with your website? It should maintain continuous uptime, work optimally for your customers, and present your business at peak performance and reliability.</p>
<h2>You cannot &#8220;Set and Forget&#8221; a Website</h2>
<p>What if the site drops offline? What if it is performing slow or something is off with its functionality, frustrating your customers, causing you to lose business? Many website owners never check their website to see how its functioning. Overlooked website issues and downtime can send visitors packing, causing you to lose money. This is why every website owner should have some sort of maintenance carried out on a monthly basis.</p>
<h2>The benefits of website maintenance:</h2>
<p>The fact is that many just have not considered the benefits of website maintenance.</p>
<p>Your website&#8217;s performance, load time, uptime and downtime all depend on the WordPress software and the plugins functioning as they are intending. </p>
<p>Your site&#8217;s growth, new content, traffic monitoring, and style changes are all dependent on you having someone making sure all updates to the websites are done smoothly, without error and without breaking anything. </p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s is my solution to you:</h2>
<p>I take great care in first backing up your website and checking it over after any updates for issues. My software keeps a record of any plugins that I update so if there are ever any issues I can easily revert back. Also included in my monthly maintenance report are security scans, performance summaries, and other benefits listed below.</p>
<h3>Why not just do it yourself?</h3>
<p>This could potentially cost you more than you think. In updating from your WordPress admin, you do not have a record of what was done. If a week later a plugin created an issue, it may be difficult to remember what you changed and how you could go about reverting your site back to a previous backup that may happen to be a very old one (which may cause you to lose content, sales orders, contacts, etc. )</p>
<p>Neglect or inexperience could damage the layout or functionality of your website. In that even you could try to fix it yourself which could risk causing more damage. You could also call in an outside developer which often comes with a hefty price tag. You see, it often takes much more to fix something than it would to routinely maintain it. Just as regular doctor checkups keep you in optimal shape, regular site maintenance helps to keep your site running properly.</p>
<h2>So Call in a Specialist</h2>
<p>Why not just stay focused on your business goals and your clients and let me deal with what I know best. By securing an experienced web professional to update and maintain your site properly you are actually saving potential lost sales and visitors.</p>
